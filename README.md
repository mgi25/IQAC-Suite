**IQAC-Suite** is a comprehensive web-based application built using Django to streamline Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) processes within academic institutions. It digitizes workflows like event proposals, report generation, and media/content requests (CDL), aligning with NAAC/NBA quality benchmarks. Alongside, it also helps in keeping track of the student performance data in order to generate a graduate transcript during graduation.
